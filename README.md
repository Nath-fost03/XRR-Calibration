# Niobium Thin Film Growth Rate Analysis

Python script for analyzing the growth rate of niobium thin films as a function of power. It performs a linear regression on experimental data and visualises the results using a scatter graph with a best-fit line.

# Overview

The script uses experimental data from a thin film deposition experiment. Growth values (in units of 10⁻¹⁰ m) were recorded for various power settings. The growth occurred over 120 seconds.

Linear regression is then used to find the relationship between applied power and growth rate, including errors the slope and intercept.
